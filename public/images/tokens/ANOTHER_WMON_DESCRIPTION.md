### Regarding why thereâ€™s another WMON logo here:

The Timeswap implementation uses this light purple version, while other dApps (like Pancake) use a logo with a dark purple background and white foreground. Feedback indicated that the WMON logo in Timeswap was incorrect, so it was specially handled here.
